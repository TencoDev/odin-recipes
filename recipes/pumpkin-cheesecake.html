        <h3>Steps to make a perfect Pumpkin Cheesecake</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Beat cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth.</li>
            <li>Add eggs, one at a time, blending well after each addition.</li>
            <li>Spread 1 cup of the cheesecake batter in the graham cracker crust.</li>
            <li>Add pumpkin puree, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg to the remaining batter; stir gently until well blended.</li>
            <li>Carefully spread the pumpkin batter on top of the plain cheesecake batter in the crust.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the edges are puffed and the surface is firm except for a small spot in the center that jiggles when the pan is gently shaken.</li>
            <li>Remove the cheesecake from the oven and set it on a wire rack to cool to room temperature, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 3 hours before serving, preferably overnight.</li>
            <li>Serve the cheesecake, topped with whipped cream if desired.</li>
        </ol>
